### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Need API keys for:

  - SSL Labs API (for security scanner)
- Need confirmation on deployment platform
- Need design assets for new tools
- Need to implement rate limiting for WHOIS API
- Need to add loading states and error handling for all tools

### Lessons
- Implement rate limiting from the start
- Use consistent error handling patterns
- Keep API responses cached where possible
- Follow security best practices for all API integrations 

## Future Plans

- Implement persistent, per-user historical data for all lookups and breach checks.
  - Add user authentication (individual logins for users).
  - Add admin login with access to all user histories and analytics.
  - Store historical data in a backend database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Supabase, or Firebase).
  - Allow users to view, search, and export their lookup/breach history.
  - Enable admin to manage users, view usage stats, and monitor system health.
- Remove the debug toggle from user profiles in production; keep it only for admin/developer accounts.
